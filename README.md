## What is Conqueror?
Conqueror is a **2D retro pixel strategy shooting game** based on **World War I**.

## How was it built?
This game has been developed using our **own custom Game Engine** written in **C++**. We drew inspiration from [Cherno's Walnut](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut). Our engine includes the following features:

- Basic **OpenGL** Features
- Graphics API Abstraction: Various APIs such as **Vulkan** or **Metal** can be easily implemented, making Conqueror compatible across **Windows, Linux, and Mac**.
- **Sprite Sheets** and **Text Rendering**
- **Sound System**

## Who built it?
Conqueror was developed by a dedicated team of **five**:

1. **Graphics Designer**: [Angelina](mailto:michelann90@gmail.com)
2. **Game Developer**: [Levi](mailto:levlau@web.de)
3. **Game Developer**: [Matthias](mailto:matthias05.geng@t-online.de)
4. **Engine Developer & Bug Fixer**: [Pascal](https://gutsche.tech)
5. **Engine Developer & Sound Maker**: [Pherel](https://phrl.dev)

## Why did we build it?
Because it was fun and we were curious! We also had the opportunity to **present our project to our entire school**, and we even created a contest to see who could survive the longest.

## When was it developed?
We worked on this project during **2022-2023** as part of a **High School seminar course**.

## Is there any documentation?
Yes there is! We have a PDF that explains Engine functions and how the Game works. [PDF](https://github.com/BunkerIndustries/Conqueror/blob/master/showcase/Conqueror.pdf)

## Platform Support
Currently, we **only provide a Windows release**. However, you can run Windows executables on Linux and Mac using [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Download).

## Open Source
Everything is **Open Source**! Feel free to explore and contribute to the codebase.
